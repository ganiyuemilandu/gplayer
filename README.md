# GPlayer
 JavaFX-oriented GUI framework for media playing and manipulation

## Description
	GPlayer is a media-playing application with a user-friendly GUI framework spawned from JavaFX.
It is designed towards facilitating improved/better media experience by creating an interactive interface, providing users with all-in-one access to their media collections, as well as granting them exclusive control over media-playing sessions.

## Features
1. AUDIO/VIDEO SUPPORT
GPlayer currently supports mp3 and wav audio formats, as well as mp4 and flv video formats.
2. PLAYLIST CREATION
As part of the push for all-in-one access to media collection, GPlayer lends support to app and user-configured playlists.
The app, on one hand, creates and manages playlists that see to user's recently played files, most played files, opened files, etc.; the user, on the other hand, can create and manage his/her own playlists, and even manage the ones created by the app to an extent.
3. APP TIMEOUT
Have you, once upon a time, put your delicious pizza in the microwave for 2 minutes, only to remember its existence after 10 minutes?  You, however, wouldn't have been worried about meeting over-cooked, close-to-burnt slices of pizza because the timeout feature would have come in handy.
GPlayer, in the same sense, provides users with a timeout feature to control the duration the app runs for.  So, no more worries about sleeping off in the middle of a boring movie and getting your battery drained unnecessarily; or even losing yourself in that long and time-consuming interesting TV-series and reporting late for an important meeting as a result.
4. MEDIAMARK FEATURE
You're watching an action movie and see some sections worth marking, perhaps to revisit at a later date, or show your friends; GPlayer has got you covered.
As you may mark sections of books to revisit, so also can you mark various sections of playing media for future reference with the aid of GPlayer Mediamark feature.
5. AUTO-RECALL
With the auto-recall feature, GPlayer is able to recollect the end-position of a play session, and would resume play from that position on subsequent start-up.
6. BASIC SYSTEM FILE OPERATIONS
Perform basic system file operations like copy, move and delete, without leaving the app.

## TODO
1. Support more audio and video formats.
2. Provide implementations for audio visualization
3. Localize in other languages

## Dependencies
	GPlayer currently depends on the following:
